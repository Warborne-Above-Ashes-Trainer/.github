## 🔧 Overview

At its core, the trainer is a **modular sandbox of toggles and sliders**:

* Adjust recoil and camera behavior without destroying weapon identity
* Smooth movement and jumps across vertical arenas
* Highlight hazards and boss telegraphs just enough to feel readable
* Run lightweight overlays for enemies, loot, and important world objects
* Save multiple configurations for different classes and modes

Nothing in the trainer rewrites server logic, damage tables, or drop rates.
It’s all about shaping **how the fight feels** on your PC.

## 🧩 Compatibility & System Focus

| Component        | Support | Notes                                          |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10 (64)  | ✔️      | Baseline target, all modules available         |
| Windows 11 (64)  | ✔️      | Recommended for best overlay latency & clarity |
| Steam Deck (Win) | ⚠️      | Works with manual scaling + key remaps         |
| Linux / Proton   | ❌       | No official overlay or hook support            |

The trainer is designed to be **lightweight**: modest CPU/GPU overhead, no invasive kernel antics, and graceful degradation if your framerate dips during VFX storms.

[!NOTE]
For multi-monitor setups, pin the trainer window to a secondary screen or minimize it entirely—everything in-game is controlled via hotkeys and overlay panels.

## ⚡ Setup Guide (Quick Start)

Follow this ritual to bring the trainer to life:

1. **Download & Extract**

   * Place the archive somewhere like:
     `C:\Tools\WarborneTrainer\`
   * Avoid installing directly into the game folder.

2. **Launch Trainer as Admin**

   * Run `Warborne-Trainer.exe` with Administrator privileges
   * This ensures input hooks and overlays behave properly.

3. **Start the Game**

   * Launch *Warborne Above Ashes* through your usual client.

4. **Open the In-Game Panel**

   * Default hotkey: **F6**
   * A slim side panel appears; you can pin or auto-hide it.

5. **Select a Base Profile**

   * `Balanced Combat` – mild recoil smoothing, basic hazard rings
   * `Boss Analysis` – stronger telegraphs, toned-down VFX, minimal loot cues
   * `Exploration Run` – mobility smoothing, loot tinting, reduced combat hints

6. **Fine-Tune & Save**

   * Adjust sliders in small increments (0.05–0.10)
   * Save as a named profile for quick swapping later.

[!IMPORTANT]
If you use other overlays (FPS counters, stream tools, GPU monitors), enable **“Safe Overlay Mode”** in the trainer’s Settings tab to avoid flicker or overlapping capture issues.

The trainer never overrides your commands—it **blends** them with configured behavior, like adding harmonies to a melody you’re already playing.

## ❓ FAQ

### Does the trainer change damage, loot RNG, or build balance?

No.
It focuses on **camera feel, recoil shape, visibility, and UI-style overlays**. The core game systems remain untouched.

### Is it detectable by other players or visible in multiplayer?

Overlays, highlights, and adjustments render **locally** only. Other players see only the standard game.

### What’s the performance impact?

On most modern systems:

* +2–4% GPU time with full overlays
* ~1% or less if you use handling tweaks only (no silhouettes, no hazard rings)

Dial back overlay density or increase `overlay_refresh_ms` in the settings if frames dip in heavy VFX arenas.

### Can I use controller instead of mouse/keyboard?

Yes.
Movement curves, jump shaping, and camera smoothing work **input-agnostic**. Aim-related modules have separate recommendations for analog sticks; you can keep them lighter for a more natural feel.

### Can I share my profiles?

All profiles live as **.json** or **.ini** files in the `profiles` folder.
Drop them onto another machine and they’ll appear in the Profile Manager after a reload.
